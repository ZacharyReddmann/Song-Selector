# Playlist Builder
Song Selector Website

This was a personal project made to assist my mother in building music playlists for our church and also practice my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. Also, the CSS was purposely designed for mobile users so it will not look pretty on a full monitor screen.

Note My node_modules folder has not been added to GitHub.
